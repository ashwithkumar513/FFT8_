Architecture design is a promising approach for designing power-efficient systems. Many
images and compression algorithms are inherently error-tolerant and might allow mistakes up to
a particular limit. In such algorithms, savings in energy can be achieved via approximating the
data path units, such as a multiplier. This report presents a novel decoder logic-primarily based
multiplier design with the intent to lessen the partial merchandise generated. Thus, leading to a
reduction in the hardware complexity and power consumption whilst retaining a low error rate.
This project constitutes the implementation of an 8x2 Multiplier using a decoder logic for low
power consumption with an appropriate error
